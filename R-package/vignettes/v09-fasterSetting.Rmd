## Introduction

The generic splicing technique certifiably guarantees the best subset can be selected in a polynomial time. 
In practice, the computational efficiency can be improved to handle large scale datasets. 
The tips for computational improvement include:       
1. use golden-section to search best support size; 
2. parallel computing when performing cross validation;         
3. covariance update for `family = "gaussian"` or `family = "mgaussian"`;         
4. approximate Newton iteration for `family = "binomial"`, `family = "poisson"`, `family = "cox"`;        
5. sure independence screening;         
6. warm-start initialization;         
7. early-stop scheme;
