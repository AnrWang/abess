## Group Selection

Group selection focuses on situations where variables possess certain group structures. For
instance, in the multifactor analysis-of-variance (ANOVA), a factor with several levels is often
represented by a group of dummy variables and in the genomic data analysis, in
which the genes belonging to the same biological pathway can be considered as a group. Thus
when the data potentially possesses group structures , we are naturally interested in selecting
a group of variables rather than an individual variable.
