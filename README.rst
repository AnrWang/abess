**abess** (Adaptive BEst Subset Selection) aims to find a small subset of predictors such
that the resulting linear model is expected to have the most desirable
prediction accuracy. This project implements a polynomial algorithm proposed to solve these problems. It supports:

-  linear regression
-  classification (binary or multi-class)
-  counting-response modeling
-  censored-response modeling
-  multi-response modeling (multi-tasks learning)
-  group best subset selection
-  nuisance penalized regression
-  sure independence screening

Installation

Performance
===========

To show the computational efficiency of abess, 
we compare abess R package with popular R libraries: glmnet, ncvreg, picasso for linear, logistic and poisson regressions; 
Timings of the CPU execution are recorded in seconds and averaged over 100 replications on a sequence
of 100 regularization parameters.

The designed matrix is formed by i.i.d sample generated from a multivariate normal distribution with mean 0 and covariance matrix :math:`\Sigma = (\sigma_{ij})`. We consider two settingsâ€”low correlation and high correlation. 
For the low correlation scenario, we set :math:`\sigma_{ij} = 0.1^{|i-j|}` and for the high correlation :math:`\sigma_{ij} = 0.7`. The number of predictors is 1000. 
The true coefficient :math:`\beta^*` is a vector with 10 nonzero entries uniformly distributed in :math:`[b,B]`. We set :math:`b=5\sqrt{2\log(p)/n}`, :math:`B = 100b` for linear regression :math:`b = 10\sqrt{2\log(p)/n}`, :math:`B = 5*b` for 
logistic regression and :math:`b = -10 \sqrt{2  \log(p) / n}`, :math:`B=10 \sqrt{2 \log(p) / n}` for poisson regression. A random noise generated from a standard Gaussian distribution is added to the linear predictor :math:`x^\prime\beta` for linear regression. 
The size of training data is 500.

All experiments are evaluated on an Intel(R) Xeon(R) 
CPU E5-2620 v4 @ 2.10GHz and under R version 3.6.1. 
for 100 replicas.

As a package solving best subset selection, abess reaches a high efficient performance especially in linear regression where it gives the fastest solution.
