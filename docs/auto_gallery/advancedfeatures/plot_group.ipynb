        "# Best group subset selection (BGSS) aims to choose a small part of non-overlapping groups to achieve the best interpretability on the response variable. BGSS is practically useful for the analysis of ubiquitously existing variables with certain group structures. For instance, a categorical variable with several levels is often represented by a group of dummy variables. Besides, in a nonparametric additive model, a continuous component can be represented by a set of basis functions (e.g., a linear combination of spline basis functions). Finally, specific prior knowledge can impose group structures on variables. A typical example is that the genes belonging to the same biological pathway can be considered as a group in the genomic data analysis.\n# \n# The BGSS can be achieved by solving:\n# \n# ..math::\n#     \\min_{\\beta\\in \\mathbb{R}^p} \\frac{1}{2n} ||y-X\\beta||_2^2,\\quad s.t.\\ ||\\beta||_{0,2}\\leq s .\n# \n# \n# where $||\\beta||_{0,2} = \\sum_{j=1}^J I(||\\beta_{G_j}||_2\\neq 0)` in which $||\\cdot||_2` is the $L_2` norm and model size $s` is a positive integer to be determined from data. Regardless of the NP-hard of this problem, Zhang et al develop a certifiably polynomial algorithm to solve it. This algorithm is integrated in the `abess` package, and user can handily select best group subset by assigning a proper value to the `group` arguments:\n# \n# We still use the dataset `dt` generated before, which has 100 samples, 5 useful variables and 15 irrelevant varibales.\n\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom abess.datasets import make_glm_data\nfrom abess.linear import LinearRegression\n\nnp.random.seed(0)\n\n# gene data\nn = 100\np = 20\nk = 5\ndt = make_glm_data(n = n, p = p, k = k, family = 'gaussian')\nprint('real coefficients:\\n', dt.coef_, '\\n')"
