        "## Integrate SIS\nUltra-high dimensional predictors increase computational cost but reduce estimation accuracy for any statistical procedure. To reduce dimensionality from high to a relatively acceptable level, a fairly general asymptotic framework, named feature screening (sure independence screening) is proposed to tackle even exponentially growing dimension. The feature screening can theoretically maintain all effective predictors with a high probability, which is called \"the sure screening property\".\n\nIn our program, to carrying out the Integrate SIS, user need to pass an integer smaller than the number of the predictors to the `screening_size`. Then the program will first calculate the marginal likelihood of each predictor and reserve those predictors with the `screening_size` largest marginal likelihood. Then, the ABESS algorithm is conducted only on this screened subset. \n\nHere is an example.\n\n"
