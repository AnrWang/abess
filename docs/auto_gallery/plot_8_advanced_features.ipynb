Actually, in our methods, the targets can be properly handled by simply change some default arguments in the functions. \n"

Under this concern, the `abess` pakcage provides option of best subset selection with $L_2$ norm regularization called the regularized bess. The model has this following form:\n\n..math::\n    \\arg\\min_\\beta L(\\beta) + \\alpha \\|\\beta\\|_2^2.\n\nTo implement the regularized bess, user need to specify a value to an additive argument `alpha` in the `LinearRegression()` function (or other methods). This value corresponds to the penalization parameter in the model above. \n\nLet\u2019s test the regularized best subset selection against the no-regularized one over 100 replicas in terms of prediction performance.

        "# Best group subset selection\n# ---------------------------------\n# Best group subset selection (BGSS) aims to choose a small part of non-overlapping groups to achieve the best interpretability on the response variable. BGSS is practically useful for the analysis of ubiquitously existing variables with certain group structures. For instance, a categorical variable with several levels is often represented by a group of dummy variables. Besides, in a nonparametric additive model, a continuous component can be represented by a set of basis functions (e.g., a linear combination of spline basis functions). Finally, specific prior knowledge can impose group structures on variables. A typical example is that the genes belonging to the same biological pathway can be considered as a group in the genomic data analysis.\n# \n# The BGSS can be achieved by solving:\n# \n# ..math::\n#     \\min_{\\beta\\in \\mathbb{R}^p} \\frac{1}{2n} ||y-X\\beta||_2^2,\\quad s.t.\\ ||\\beta||_{0,2}\\leq s .\n# \n# \n# where $||\\beta||_{0,2} = \\sum_{j=1}^J I(||\\beta_{G_j}||_2\\neq 0)` in which $||\\cdot||_2` is the $L_2` norm and model size $s` is a positive integer to be determined from data. Regardless of the NP-hard of this problem, Zhang et al develop a certifiably polynomial algorithm to solve it. This algorithm is integrated in the `abess` package, and user can handily select best group subset by assigning a proper value to the `group` arguments:\n# \n# We still use the dataset `dt` generated before, which has 100 samples, 5 useful variables and 15 irrelevant varibales.\n\n\n\nprint('real coefficients:\\n', dt.coef_, '\\n')\n\n\n# Support we have some prior information that every 5 variables as a group:\n\n\n\ngroup = np.linspace(0, 3, 4).repeat(5)\nprint('group index:\\n', group)\n\n\n# Then we can set the `group` argument in function. Besides, the `support_size` here indicates the number of groups, instead of the number of variables.\n\n\n\nmodel = LinearRegression(support_size = range(0, 3))\nmodel.fit(dt.x, dt.y, group = group)\nprint('coefficients:\\n', model.coef_)"

To reduce dimensionality from high to a relatively acceptable level, a fairly general asymptotic framework, named feature screening (sure independence screening) is proposed to tackle even exponentially growing dimension. The feature screening can theoretically maintain all effective predictors with a high probability, which is called \"the sure screening property\".\n\nIn our program, to carrying out the Integrate SIS, user need to pass an integer smaller than the number of the predictors to the `screening_size`. Then the program will first calculate the marginal likelihood of each predictor and reserve those predictors with the `screening_size` largest marginal likelihood. Then, the ABESS algorithm is conducted only on this screened subset. \n\nHere is an example.\n\n"
