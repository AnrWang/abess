In this part, we are going to explore the power of the abess package
using simulated data. We compare the abess package with popular Python
packages:
`scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html#supervised-learning>`__
for linear and logistic regressions in the following section. Actually,
we also compare with
`python-glmnet <https://github.com/civisanalytics/python-glmnet>`__,
`statsmodels <https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels>`__ and
`L0bnb <https://github.com/alisaab/l0bnb>`__, but the python-glmnet
presents a poor prediction error, the statsmodels runs slow and the
L0bnb cannot adaptively choose sparsity level. So their results are not
showed here.

Simulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Setting
~~~~~~~
Both packages are compared in three aspects including the prediction
performance, the variable selection performance, and the computation
efficiency.

-  The prediction performance of the linear model is measured by
   :math:`||y−\hat{y}||_2` on a test set and for logistic regression
   this is measured by the area under the ROC Curve (AUC).
-  For the variable selection performance, we compute the coefficient
   error :math:`||\beta - \hat{\beta}||_2`, true positive rate (TPR,
   which is the proportion of varibales in the active set that are
   correctly identified) and the false positive rate (FPR, which is the
   proportion of the varibales in the inactive set that are falsely
   identified as a signal).

-  Timings of the CPU execution are recorded in seconds and all the
   performances are averaged over 20 replications on a sequence of 100
   regularization parameters.
The simulated data are made by ``abess.datasets.make_glm_data()``. The
number of predictors is :math:`p=8000` and the size of data is
:math:`n=500`. The true coefficient contains :math:`k=10` nonzero
entries uniformly distributed in :math:`[b,B]`. For linear (gaussian)
data, we set :math:`b = 5\sqrt{2\ln p / n}` and :math:`B = 100b`. For
logistic (binomial) data, we set :math:`b = 10\sqrt{2\ln p / n}` and
:math:`B = 5b`. In each regression, we test for both low
(:math:`\rho=0.1`) and high correlation (:math:`\rho=0.7`) scenarios.
What’s more, a random noise generated from a standard Gaussian
distribution is added to the linear predictor :math:`x′β` for linear
regression.

All experiments are evaluated on a Ubuntu platform with Intel(R)
Core(TM) i9-9940X CPU @ 3.30GHz and 48 RAM.

Results
~~~~~~~

For linear regression, we compare three methods in the two packages:
Lasso, OMP and abess. For logistic regression, we compare two
methods: lasso and abess.
The results are presented in the following pictures. The first column is
the result of linear regression and the second one is of logistic
regression.
-  Firstly, among all of the methods implemented in different packages,
   the estimator obtained by the abess package shows both the best
   prediction performance and the best coefficient error.

-  Secondly, the estimator obtained by the abess package can reasonably
   control FPR in a low level while the TPR stays at 1. (Since all
   methods’ TPR are 1, the figure is not plotted.)

-  Furthermore, our abess package is highly efficient compared with
   other packages, especially in the linear regression.
