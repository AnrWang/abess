We compare `abess` and other well-known algorithms under linear regression and logistic regression model. 
The comparison is conducted on both Python and R environments. Here is the code.

## Python

- Run `plot_results_figure.py` to reproduce the simulation results in demonstrated in: https://abess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_gallery/1-glm/plot_a1_power_of_abess.html;
- Run `plot_important_search.py` to reproduce the lastest figure in: https://abess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_gallery/4-computation-tips/plot_large_dimension.html#experimental-evidences-important-searching.

## R

- Run `run_benchmark.R` to reproduce [this article](https://abess-team.github.io/abess/articles/v11-power-of-abess.html#results).
