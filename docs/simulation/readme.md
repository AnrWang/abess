# Simulation Code

We compare linear and logistic problems between abess and other algorithms in both Python and R. Here is the code.

## Python

- Run `plot_results_figure.py` to reproduce [this article](https://abess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_gallery/1-glm/plot_a1_power_of_abess.html#numerical-results);
- Run `plot_impsearch.py` to reproduce [this article](https://abess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_gallery/4-computation-tips/plot_large_dimension.html#experimental-evidences-important-searching).

## R

- Run `timings.R` to reproduce [this article](https://abess-team.github.io/abess/articles/v11-power-of-abess.html#results).
