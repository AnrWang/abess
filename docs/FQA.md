## Installation failed

### Compliers

First of all, please check the version of Python and GCC.
To make sure that `abess` package runs correctly, 

- Python 2.7 or later is required
- GCC 4.7 or later is required (support c++11)

What's more, the newer version is recommended. So if you meet some 
errors, please try to update the complier first.

## Import failed

### Folder name

Make sure your working folder path is not named "abess". If not, Python would not import the `abess` packages and give some errors.
